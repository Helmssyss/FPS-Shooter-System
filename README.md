### Note:
-  _What distinguishes this system from my other repos is that I focus entirely on C++ and use Timeline._
-  My other repos:
    - [TPS-Shooter-System | Intermediate](https://github.com/Helmssyss/TPS-Shooter-System-Alternative)
    - [TPS-Shooter-System | Beginner](https://github.com/Helmssyss/TPS-Shooter-System)

  # I was inspired by while writing this system is BattleField1.
